# CoMBI-Universal
This CoMBI controller is compatible with any microtomes. Hall sensor detect handle position and sync camera shutter release by ATmega328P. 

The codes were written by Arduino IDE. The circuit was made using a universal board.

Attach a neodymium magnet (10 to 15 mm in diameter and 3 mm thick) to the handle of the microtome using double-sided tape or a rubber magnet with tape.

Place the Hall sensor beside the handle. 5 to 15 mm apart from neodymium magnet. If you use two or more neodymium magnet, you will get more magnetic power and longer distance between sensor and magnet.

I comfirmed operation using LEICA CM3050 rotary cryostat, YAMATO REM710 sliding microtome, YAMATO rotary microtome in 1963 (no product number, old fashioned!).
